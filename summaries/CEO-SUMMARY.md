# Try on Haul - CEO Summary

> **Audience**: CEO, founders, board members  
> **Last Updated**: 2026-02-09

## The Opportunity

**Problem**: Online shoppers can't try on clothes before buying. This leads to:
- High return rates (30-40% for apparel)
- Cart abandonment from uncertainty
- Poor shopping experience

**Solution**: Try on Haul lets users see themselves wearing any outfit before they buy—using AI to create realistic photos in seconds.

---

## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **Upload a selfie** - One photo of yourself
2. **Add an outfit** - Paste a link or upload an image
3. **Pick a vibe** - Choose a festival scene (Burning Man, Coachella, etc.)
4. **See yourself** - AI generates you wearing that outfit
5. **Share it** - Post directly to Instagram, TikTok, Facebook

**Time to result**: Under 90 seconds

## Why Festival Fashion?

| Factor | Advantage |
|--------|-----------|
| **High engagement** | Festival-goers are highly active on social media |
| **Shareable content** | "Look at my Burning Man outfit" is inherently viral |
| **Distinct aesthetic** | Clear niche = easier marketing, less competition |
| **Premium pricing** | Festival outfits = higher purchase values = better commissions |

---

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

| Stream | How It Works | Timeline |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Affiliate Commissions** | We track outfit purchases through our links (5-10% cut) | MVP |
| **Viral Growth** | Every share = free marketing with our branding | MVP |
| **Partner Widget** | Retailers embed our try-on on their sites (B2B) | Post-MVP |
| **Premium Features** | More generations, saved looks, priority processing | Future |

### Unit Economics (Projected)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cost per try-on | ~$0.06 |
| Average affiliate commission | ~$3 per sale |
| Conversion rate (try-on → purchase) | ~3% estimated |
| Break-even try-ons per sale | ~50 |

**Reality check**: Affiliate alone won't cover costs at scale. Partner deals and premium features needed for profitability.
