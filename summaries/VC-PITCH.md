## 1. The Problem

### Online Fashion is Broken

**$1.7 trillion** global fashion e-commerce market, yet:

- **30-40% return rate** for online apparel (vs 8% in-store)
- **$550B** lost annually to returns (Optoro, 2023)
- **#1 reason**: "Didn't look right on me"

> *"I loved it online, but it looked completely different when I tried it on."*  
> — Every online shopper, ever

## 2. The Solution

### Try on Haul: Virtual Try-On for the Social Era

**Upload → Try On → Share → Buy**

Users see themselves wearing any outfit in seconds—using AI that preserves their face and body exactly.

**The magic**: Not just a try-on tool. A **content creation engine** that drives viral sharing and affiliate revenue.

---

## 7. Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Viral Consumer Growth (Months 1-6)

```
User generates try-on → Shares to social (branded) → 
Friends see → Friends sign up → Repeat
```

**Target metrics**:
- 30% share rate
- 1.2 viral coefficient
- 80% organic acquisition

### Phase 2: Retailer Partnerships (Months 4-12)

**Strategy**: Prove value with data, then sell to retailers

- "Your products get tried on X times/month on Try on Haul"
- "Here's the conversion data"
- "Want this on your own site?"

### Phase 3: Platform Expansion (Year 2+)

- Expand beyond festival fashion
- White-label solution for enterprises
- International markets

## 8. Competitive Landscape

| Player | Approach | Weakness |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Zeekit (Walmart)** | Enterprise B2B | Closed ecosystem, no consumer play |
| **Vue.ai** | B2B SaaS | No viral growth, complex integration |
| **Snap AR** | Camera filters | Not realistic enough, no shopping intent |
| **Amazon** | In-app try-on | Only Amazon products, no social |

### Our Differentiation

✅ **Consumer-first**: Free, frictionless, viral  
✅ **Social-native**: Built for sharing, not just viewing  
✅ **Niche-focused**: Own festival fashion, then expand  
✅ **Data moat**: Learn what styles convert, for whom
