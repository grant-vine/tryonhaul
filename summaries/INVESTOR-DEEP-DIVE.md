## Technology & IP

### Core Technology

| Component | Approach | Defensibility |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| AI try-on | Third-party APIs (fal.ai, FASHN) | Low - commodity |
| Provider adapter | Proprietary abstraction layer | Medium - operational advantage |
| Scene compositing | Custom post-processing | Medium - differentiating feature |
| Sharing pipeline | Web Share API integration | Low - replicable |

### Data Moat (Emerging)

As we scale, we accumulate valuable data:
- Which styles get tried on most (trend prediction)
- Which styles convert (merchandising insights)
- User preference clusters (personalization)

This data becomes increasingly valuable to retailers.

### Patents

Currently: None filed (pre-revenue, focusing on execution)

Future consideration: Scene compositing method, affiliate attribution in shared images
