## One-Liner

**Try on Haul lets you see yourself wearing any outfit—before you buy it.**

## Boilerplate (50 words)

Try on Haul is a free virtual try-on app for festival fashion. Users upload a selfie, add an outfit, and AI generates a realistic photo of them wearing it—complete with festival scene backgrounds. Results can be shared instantly to Instagram, TikTok, and other platforms.

## Extended Description (150 words)

Try on Haul solves one of online shopping's biggest problems: not knowing how clothes will look on you.

Using cutting-edge AI technology, Try on Haul creates realistic photos of users wearing any outfit they find online. The magic happens in under 90 seconds—upload a selfie, paste an outfit link, and watch as you're transported to Burning Man or Coachella wearing your new look.

But Try on Haul isn't just a utility—it's a content creation tool. Every try-on is designed to be shared. Users post their virtual looks to Instagram and TikTok, showing friends their festival outfit ideas and discovering new styles together.

For fashion retailers, Try on Haul drives traffic and reduces returns. Users who try on are more confident buyers, and every share includes a link back to the product.

Try before you buy. Share before you wear.

## Founder Story

*[Placeholder for founder narrative]*

> "We built Try on Haul because we were tired of ordering festival outfits that looked nothing like the photos. We wanted to see ourselves in those outfits, in those settings, before spending $200 on a bodysuit we'd return in two weeks."

## The Technology

Try on Haul uses state-of-the-art AI image generation to create realistic virtual try-ons:

- **Face & body preservation**: Your face and body shape stay exactly the same
- **Garment transfer**: The outfit is realistically placed on your body
- **Scene compositing**: Optional festival backgrounds (desert, stages, forests)
- **Privacy-first**: Images are processed and deleted within 1 hour

The technology is based on recent advances in diffusion models and virtual try-on research (CatVTON, published at ICLR 2025).
