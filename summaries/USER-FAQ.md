### About the Try-Ons

**How long does it take?**  
Usually 60-90 seconds. You can wait on the page or leave—we'll notify you when it's ready.

**Why does my try-on look weird?**  
Common issues:
- **Blurry face**: Use a clearer, higher-resolution photo
- **Wrong body shape**: The AI works best with front-facing, standing poses
- **Outfit not fitting**: Some complex outfits (lots of layers, unusual shapes) are harder for the AI

**Can I try on multiple outfits at once?**  
Not yet—one outfit per try-on. But you can generate up to 5 per day!

**Can I try tops AND bottoms together?**  
Currently, we support one garment at a time. Full outfit combinations are coming soon!
